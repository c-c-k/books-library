ACTION PLAN
========================================================================

STAGE 0 - GLOBAL NOTES:
-----------------------

- Start from the first step of the first stage.
- Don't get distracted, focus on one step at a time.
- If a thought or an idea pertaining to another step comes up, add it to these global notes, move it to the appropriate step while introspecting the whole, and, deal with it only when dealing with the relevant step.
- If the current step becomes impossible or too hard, reflect on previous step or steps that might be the root of the problem and start fixing things from there.
- Don't Panic.

STAGE 1 - PROJECT ABSTRACT OUTLINE:
-----------------------------------

Preparatory steps defining the projects goals and intentions:
    #. Copy the original project assignment file to the docs dir.

    #. Based on the original assignment write MVC abstracts:
        - Model abstract.
        - View abstract.
        - Controller abstract.

    #. Add/update stage 2 action plan.
