Welcome to BooksLibrary's documentation!
========================================

This project started as the summary project for the "Python Fundamentals" section of John Bryce mediatech's "Python Fullstack" course.

Currently, it was switched to MDNs' `"Local Library" tutorial`_.

The project's goal is to build a simple and minimalistic local book library management system.
